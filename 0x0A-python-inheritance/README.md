**Inheritance in Python**

*One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance.
It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties
and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to
derive or inherit the properties from another class.*

Benefits of inheritance are:

*Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class.
The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:*

*It represents real-world relationships well.*

*It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.*

*It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.*

*Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.*

*Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.*
